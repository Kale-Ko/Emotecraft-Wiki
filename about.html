            ## About

            Emotecraft is a mod for Minecraft Java that allows you to play emotes like on Minecraft Bedrock.\
            It supports forge and fabric and is usually pretty quick to update to new versions of the game.

            Downloads can be found [here](./downloads)

            **Important Note:** The mod or plugin must also be installed on the server to be able to see others emotes.

            Different mod loaders (forge/fabric) are fully compatible with each other and also the bukkit plugin, however different versions may not be (eg. 2.1 SNAPSHOT-build.6 might not work with 2.1 SNAPSHOT-build.10)
