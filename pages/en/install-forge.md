## Installing on Forge

To install the mod on Forge you first need the jar.\
You can download it from [here](./downloads). **(Make sure you download the Forge version)**

Once you have the mod you need to put it in your mods folder\
Windows: `C:/Users/{your user}/AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/mods` aka `%appdata%/.minecraft/mods`\
Linux: `/home/{your user}/.minecraft/mods` aka `~/.minecraft/mods`\
Max OS: `/Users/{your user}/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods` aka `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods`

Then you just need to start/restart your Minecraft client.
