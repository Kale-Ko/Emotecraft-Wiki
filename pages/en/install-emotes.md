## Installing Custom Emotes

To install an emote you simple need to drag the .json or .emotecraft file into the emotes folder.

The emotes folder is located at\
Windows: `C:/Users/{your user}/AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/emotes` aka `%appdata%/.minecraft/emotes`\
Linux: `/home/{your user}/.minecraft/emotes` aka `~/.minecraft/emotes`\
Max OS: `/Users/{your user}/Library/Application Support/minecraft/emotes` aka `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/emotes`

Then restart your game and the emotes will show up.
