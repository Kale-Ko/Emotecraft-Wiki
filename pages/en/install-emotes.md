## Installing Custom Emotes

To install an emote you simple need to drag the `.emotecraft` or `.json` file from your downloads folder into the emotes folder which is located at

Windows: `C:/Users/{your user}/AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/emotes`\
Mac: `/Users/{your user}/Library/Application Support/minecraft/emotes`\
Linux: `/home/{your user}/.minecraft/emotes`

Restart your game and the emotes will show up.
