## Creating Music for Emotes

To start you will need [Open Note Block Studio](https://opennbs.org/). Click download and then run the installer.

Once that is done run the program, you should be greeted with a blank song. Here you can create the song (If you need help see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFXzons84U8))

When you are done the song click save and save it to the emotes folder as `{nameofemotefile}.nbs`.
