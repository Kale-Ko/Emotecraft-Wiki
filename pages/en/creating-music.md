## Creating Music for Emotes

To start you will need [Open Note Block Studio](https://opennbs.org/). Click download and then run the installer.

Once that is done run the program, you should be greeted with a blank song. Here you can create the song (If you need help see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFXzons84U8))

<span style="color: yellow;">**Important Note:**</span> You may only use the default Minecraft sounds\
<span style="color: yellow;">**Important Note:**</span> The file may not be any bigger than 32kb or it will crash on servers

When you are done the song click save and save it to the emotes folder as `{nameOfEmoteFile}.nbs`. Then restart your game and it should work.
