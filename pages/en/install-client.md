## Installing on Fabric/Forge

To install the mod you first need to download the jar.\
You can find it [here](%downloads). **(Make sure you download the correct version)**

If you are installing it on Fabric you will also need Fabric API ([Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions), [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files)),\
and it is recommended you use Mod Menu ([Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions), [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu/files)).

If you are installing it on Forge you will need to download playerAnimator ([Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/playeranimator/versions), [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/playeranimator/files)) and bendy-lib ([Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/bendy-lib/versions), [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bendy-lib/files)) as they are not embedded in the mod.

Once you have the mod(s) you just need to put them in your mods folder located at

Windows: `C:/Users/{your user}/AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/mods`\
Mac: `/Users/{your user}/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods`\
Linux: `/home/{your user}/.minecraft/mods`

Then start/restart your Minecraft client.
