## Downloading Custom Emotes

Currently you can download emotes either from [#emote-list](https://discord.com/invite/CNnyrqvD2H) in the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/38e348fxVS) or from the old [Emote archive](https://github.com/KosmX/Emotecraft-emotes).

In the Discord server find the emote you want from #emote-list and then click the title of the embed (For older emotes click the download button in the bottom right).

In the emote archive find the emote you want (eg. <https://github.com/KosmX/Emotecraft-emotes/blob/master/emotes/Twerk.json>). Then click the "Raw" button. Finally Right Click -> Save as.

Next see [Installing Custom Emotes](./install-emotes) to install them from there.
