## Downloads

For Forge and Fabric downloads it is recommended to use [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/emotecraft/versions).\
but you can also use Curseforge ([Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/emotecraft-forge/files), [Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/emotecraft/files))

For the Bukkit plugin go [here](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/emotecraft-bukkit/files).

The most up to date versions for all loaders can also be found on [Github](https://github.com/KosmX/emotes/releases).

Next see [Installing on Fabric](./install-fabric) or [Installing on Forge](./install-forge) to install the mod.
