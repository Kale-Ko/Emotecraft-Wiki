# Emotecraft Wiki

## Translating/Contributing to the Wiki

To contribute to the wiki you just need a GitHub account and some basic knowledge of how to use it.

To start make a fork of the repository from [here](https://github.com/Kale-Ko/Emotecraft-Wiki/fork).\
When it finishes you will have a copy of the original repository that you can mess around in.

If you would like you can clone this new repo locally to your computer to edit it there with `git clone https://github.com/{your name}/Emotecraft-Wiki` (You must already have git setup)

### Translating a page

If you would like to translate a page open up the pages directory and then whatever language your would like to translate (All of the directories are two letter language codes)

If the language you would like to translate does not already exist then you must create it yourself along with a language.json file (See [this](https://github.com/Kale-Ko/Emotecraft-Wiki/blob/master/pages/en/language.json))\
You must also add the language code to the [languages.json](https://github.com/Kale-Ko/Emotecraft-Wiki/blob/master/pages/languages.json) file\
**(Note you must also translate home and sidebar at least because the page relies on those)**

Next you gotta pick a page to translate. Once you have you can either copy the file to the new language folder or create a new file with the same name.\
Then you can translate it.

### Adding a page

Adding a page is pretty much identical to translating a page except you just create a new file for whatever language you want. (Make sure this file follows close to the the same format as the others)

### Editing a page

Editing a page is also pretty simple, just edit whichever page you want to.

### Contributing your changes

When you are finished translating all the pages you want to you just need to request for the changes to be added\
(If you cloned the repo locally make sure to commit everything)

If you head back to your repository (`https://github.com/{your name}/Emotecraft-Wiki`) you should see a button that says Contribute above the files list, click that and then Open Pull Request. Once that loads just click Create pull request.\
Here you will want to give your changes a title and description. When you finish typing that click Create pull request.\
You changes will be reviewed soon and if they are approved they will be added to the wiki.
