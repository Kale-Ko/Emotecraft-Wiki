## Sharing Emotes

Once you have an emote you might want to share it with other people, to do this you can post it to the [Emotes Open Collection](https://emotes.kosmx.dev/)

To get started you need to [login](https://emotes.kosmx.dev/user). Then you can navigate to [Upload an emote](https://emotes.kosmx.dev/e/new)

Here you will upload your emote.json. After that you may change some of the metadata along with the visibility of the emote. When you are done just click Publish!
