## Sharing Emotes

Once you have an emote you might want to share it with other people, to do this you can post it to the [Emotes Open Collection](https://emotes.kosmx.dev/)

To get started you need to [login](https://emotes.kosmx.dev/user). Once you are done navigate to [Upload an emote](https://emotes.kosmx.dev/e/new)

Here you will upload your `.json` or `.emotecraft` file, and if you have it an icon for the emote. After that you may change some of the metadata along with the visibility of the emote.

When you are done just click Publish!
