## Sharing Emotes

Once you have an emote you might want to share it with other people, you can post it in [#emote-list](https://discord.com/invite/CNnyrqvD2H) in the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/38e348fxVS).\
All you need is a title, description, the .json file, and an image of the emote.

To post the emote send `?postEmote "{title}" "{description}"` in #bot-commands with the .json and the image attached to the message.
