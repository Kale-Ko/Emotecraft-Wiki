## Creating Emotes With Blockbench

**This requires basic knowledge of how to move and rotate objects as well as use keyframes in blockbench.** For help with this see [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjl_U0ndTXFc--5aIGQhcKQd8pOa99iK-).

To start you are going to need [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/downloads).

Then you are going to need the Blockbench model. You can get it [here](./downloads#tool-downloads).
**Note that the Blockbench model does not support bends**

Once you have Blockbench installed open the model.\
To get started switch to the Animate tab.

In the top left click the Add Animation button.\
You can change the name and other parameters however you like. When your done click confirm.

You can now move and rotate any of the joints how you want and add keyframes.

When you are done, click the save button (Or `Ctrl + S`) and save it as emote.json (Or anything else as long as it ends in .json)

Next see [Installing Custom Emotes](./install-emotes) to install the emote you created.\
If you are testing your emote a lot it is recommended you use [The Helpful Feature](./a-helpful-feature) but if you want you can still install it every time.

If you want you can add an icon for your emote, just put the image in the emotes folder as `{nameOfEmoteFile}.png`
You can also add music to your emotes. See [here](./creating-music)
