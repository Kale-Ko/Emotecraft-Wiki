Emotecraft is a mod for Minecraft Java that allows you to play emotes like on Minecraft Bedrock.

It supports both Fabric and Forge and is usually pretty quick to update to new versions of the game.\
Downloads can be found [here](%downloads).

<span style="color: yellow;">**Important Note:**</span> The mod or plugin must also be installed on the server to be able to see other people's emotes.

Different mod loaders (Fabric/Forge) are also fully compatible with one another and the plugins, however different versions may not be (eg. 2.1.4 might not work with 2.0.1).
