It supports Forge and Fabric and is usually pretty quick to update to new versions of the game.\
Downloads can be found [here](./downloads).

<span style="color: yellow;">**Important Note:**</span> The mod or plugin must also be installed on the server to be able to see other peoples emotes.

Different mod loaders (Forge/Fabric) are also fully compatible with each other and the plugins, however different versions may not be (eg. 2.1.4 might not work with 2.1.1).
