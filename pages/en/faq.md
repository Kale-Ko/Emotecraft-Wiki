### Do custom emotes need to be installed on all clients/the server to work?

No, they only need to be on the client that is playing the emote OR the server.

### Does the mod need to be on the server?

Yes, the mod must be on the server to see other peoples emotes.

### Can you make the mod for x version

Probably not, I don't have time for that. However Emotecraft is modular so you don't have to rewrite/remap the whole mod if you port it.
If you want to try it and you need help, contact `KosmX#7620` on Discord.

### Why can't I see my custom emotes

Make sure Load emotes on logical server (In the hidden config) is off.\
Make sure the emotes are valid jsons (If you open them up in notepad the first line should be a {).\
If it is a Blockbench emote make sure you are using version 2.1 or newer.
