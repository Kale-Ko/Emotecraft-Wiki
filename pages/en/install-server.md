## Installing on a Server

If you are using a Fabric or Forge server you can use [this](./install-fabric) or [this](./install-forge)

To install the plugin on a Server you first need the jar.\
You can download it from [here](./downloads). **(Make sure you download the correct version (Bukkit(For Bukkit/Spigot/Paper servers) or Bungee(for Bungee/Waterfall servers)))**

Once you have the plugin you need to put them in your plugins folder `{server}/plugins`

Then you just need to start/restart your Minecraft server.
