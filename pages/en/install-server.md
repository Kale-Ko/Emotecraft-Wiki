## Installing on Bukkit/Spigot/Bungee

To install the plugin you first need to download the jar.\
You can find it [here](./downloads). **(Make sure you download the correct version)**

If you are installing it on Bukkit/Spigot and would like to be able to use commands you will also need [Emotecraft command extensions](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/emotecraft-command-extension/files) which requires [ProtocolLib](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/protocollib/files) and [CommandAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/api-commandapi-1-13-1-19-2.62353/).

Once you have the plugin(s) you just need to put them in your plugins folder located at `{serverPath}/plugins`.

Then you just need to start/restart your Minecraft server.
