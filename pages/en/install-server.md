## Installing on Spigot/Bukkit

To install the plugin you first need to download the jar.\
You can find it [here](%downloads). **(Make sure you download the correct version)**

If you would like to be able to use commands you will also need [Emotecraft command extensions](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/emotecraft-command-extension/files) which requires [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1997/) and [CommandAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/62353/).

Once you have the plugin(s) you just need to put them in your plugins folder located at `{serverPath}/plugins`.

Then start/restart your Minecraft server.
