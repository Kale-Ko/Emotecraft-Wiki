## Installing on a Server

If you are using a Fabric or Forge server see [this](./install-client) (Just note the mods dir will just be `{server}/mods`)

To install the plugin you first need to download the jar.\
You can find it [here](./downloads). **(Make sure you download the correct version)**

Once you have the plugin you just need to put it in your plugins folder `{server}/plugins`

Then you just need to start/restart your Minecraft server.
