## A Helpful Feature

If you are trying to quickly create and test emotes it can be a pain to have to restart Minecraft every time you want to test it.\
So instead if you place the emote file at `{.minecraft}/emote.json` and restart your game a special feature will be enabled in the mod.

If you press the O key (Or whatever, its a configurable keybind) it will load the emote.json file and then attempt to play the emote so you don't have to restart each time.\
This will also provide additional feedback in the game log if something goes wrong.
